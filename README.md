🎥 YouTube Hand Controller Using Hand Gestures (Python + OpenCV + MediaPipe)
Control YouTube videos with just your hand gestures — no keyboard, no mouse!

This project uses computer vision and hand tracking to detect specific hand signs and perform YouTube actions like Play/Pause, Forward, Rewind, Volume Up, and Volume Down using real-time webcam input.

✨ Features:
🔴 Real-time hand gesture detection
🖐️ Five custom gestures mapped to YouTube controls
🎯 Works on any browser with YouTube open
💻 Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe
🔊 Hands-free and touchless media control

🧠 Technologies Used:
Python 3.x
OpenCV – for video processing
MediaPipe – for hand tracking and landmark detection
PyAutoGUI – to simulate keyboard shortcuts

🖐️ Gesture Mappings:
Gesture	Action
✊🏼 Fist	Play / Pause
👉🏼 Point Right	Forward 10 seconds
👈🏼 Point Left	Backward 10 seconds
👆🏼 Point Up	Volume Up
✌🏼 Two Fingers	Volume Down

All gestures are detected via webcam and mapped to YouTube keyboard shortcuts using PyAutoGUI.

🚀 Use Cases
Accessibility-friendly YouTube control
Touchless interaction for hygiene-sensitive environments
